# <a name="descr"></a>Description
The FabFed is a Python library for a cross-testbed federation framework that (1) models the network experiment (or "slice") across the FABRIC testbed and federated testbeds and providers, and (2) provides workflow tools to stitch l2 and l3 networks between the testbeds and providers.

The FabFed code took the initial form from the Mobius API, and refactored and reinvented the slice modeling, user interface, data structure and  stitching workflows. 

An example FabFed slice for users would look like the below.
